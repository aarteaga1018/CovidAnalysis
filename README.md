Covid Analysis with Python

We will explore covid 19 data published by John Hopkins University and see if there is a correlation between the spread of the virus and how happy people are living the country. 

The notebook will display the data pulled from the csv file. The data will then be cleaned by dropping unnecessary columns and aggregating columns. After cleaning through the data, explore what are good calculation measures to use. Used data to find correlations and finally visualize results using Seaborn.
